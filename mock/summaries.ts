      " [Music] foreign [Music] enjoying your day so far we called it blowing up Friday for a very good reason some teams are certainly gonna have to consider changes after the result of today but not the Vegas Legion necessarily they put themselves in a very good position to secure winners bracket for the first time in their franchise history with Victory today against an all-out of sorts Minnesota rocker that surely have got to do something very much in Twitter your thoughts in the comments below hit the like button if you enjoy subscribe if you're new as always I'd greatly appreciate it first of all a brand new series here from crimsex New YouTube series daily uploads coming out for the people first episode I believe already dropped down he did a great introduction here I think content like this person it could you know Crim could put this behind a payroll he could do some of this stuff to the public he could put some of it behind uh you know like I did scumpty like one of those Master Class things at one point on how to play code or something and um you know Crim could put this on the skillshare or something like that I think it'd be kind of interesting but it's good that we get it for free so that's all it's gonna be every day new episode with chrome telling you how to play COD all the secrets that he's learned across his career so gonna be very interesting content part-time idiot part-time genius I just noticed here so that's pretty good stuff and then yeah that's going on over the coming days another interesting piece of news as well from kevi's skills if you guys don't know Kevin he's been around for almost a decade writing Cody says nine years ago this kind of Journey started of course does a lot of moderating for the big craters in the Cod scene was doing content with skunk for some time was doing his Twitter videos his YouTube stuff for quite a while and now scop's gone full-time content it seems scump has decided to change tack with who he's gonna have as his video editor and um there's been some controversy about this I don't really think we need to read into any of the drama here but um you know Kerry does saying the reply is this news was unexpected so he's going to be back stronger so you know it doesn't seem to me that Kevy is going to be like joining optic full-time or something as a Content guy and that's kind of the big announcement or whatever but um you know he does still work with courage I believe so at least there's that still going on but interesting right that scump after going full time I guess wants to maybe take his content to the next level or probably wants to get some maybe in-house to do it on uptake that might make sense as well because Kevin I believe is UK based and maybe time zones and other things scum now that he's full time maybe wants to get someone else in I don't know difficult to read into I know that he was asking or answering questions about this on stream and um that I never really said too much of the sort so we'll see what happens over the coming days here with uh you know scump's next step is clear but of course they've got the breakdown to do on Sunday this weekend with that brand new content show they're doing with scuppern methods that's very exciting with all the talk that they have about it at the present time these are the standings then going into today's games so Vegas sat at one and two a five in seven map counts we'll see in a few seconds time here where they sit now and they sit in a certainly a promising position rocket they were already out of it gorillas already looking so for them are Owen Three Ravens in a similar spot certainly after today and surge as you might expect quite quickly went up 2-0 in this series they actually dominated the search and destroyers while it does feel like serger put good work into their search and finally accuracy is looking pretty good in Search and Destroy you we expected it all year after because he typically his Search and Destroy is arguably his best mode and finally he's showing some life in that mode this season that's going to be crucial for Seattle they do lose the control in this series they're not winning it regardless so um yeah London actually somehow won the control honestly it was what we want to be because Fortress is such a good map typically for surge that I thought this series was absolutely done and dusted right after this one turned it not to be the case though in London somehow fought back but um wasn't to beat they lost the game four could actually tweeted up GG's lag before he corrected it into Gigi's London like he didn't even know who he was playing he was just straight up frog on the map SMD looking a lot better and I believe that Miles said on the broadcast that this freezing issue we were getting was um you know broadcast side only and yet the game was actually fine for the players now Fred disagrees with that and says you know maybe that was never right to begin with I don't know he says the freezing mid game needs to be fixed so yeah I don't really know if too many of the London guys commented on this but Fred was clearly not happy with all the freezing issues that were being had certainly in that game through control and I thought okay is this just on the broadcast but only no apparently the players are having it as well so that's obviously not ideal but um you know at the end of the day the writer team I think won the series speaking of sir just wanted to show an interesting Clipper that came up from scump stream where he was discussing or method asked him the question who are the most skilled mechanical players in the game given like a you know top five list I feel like their list of three smg's three ARS was pretty good to be honest but um I did I was thinking in my head like you've got to say simp do it agree yes Tim hasn't been so good but in terms of pure mechanical Roar ability simp is definitely one of the best and deserves to be in the conversation even if his numbers aren't so great let's say they're so far this season difficult question to answer though most mechanically gifted players like you know I think you've got to do a top 10 at that point to really get to the weeds of which players deserve it from whichever roles five mechanics for the moment a lot of times we're doing the top six I'd have those three subscribe to shout as well and Prince got to be in the conversation as well he has been the Brawner for the last 10 series here right okay he against face he had a point nine but outside of that 1.2 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.1 1.5 2 2 you know oval at 1.21 four and six record though out of those uh 10 dominant performances four and six record for pred so he's coming different and they're looking good of course they're going to be in the winners bracket for the major here so they'll be in a decent spot to make a decent run the overall numbers look like this accuracy individually had a good series statistically most damage in the lobby actually as well a bit of a stinky one for Paul on the other side so you know I don't know I'm just not convinced this on the team I thought they'd make a change a while ago I thought they might even bring zero back or something they haven't done that you know they need to get a Harry you're a gizmo or just something right I mean it's so obvious no but they just haven't done it for some reason accuracy had a good individual performance statistically he was making some questionable plays to be honest in that final high point that they almost didn't win but um they did eventually get over the line the second series though and this is the one that I was actually looking forward to today the other ones meant less to me than Vegas versus Minnesota Social rocker because rocker in the situation where if they lost this surely it's chalked for their team and Vegas needed to win or at least needed to stay very competitive to give themselves a good chance of qualifying it winners for the major game one Minnesota managed to take it like Vegas tried their best but it wasn't to be and I'm still not sold on this Vegas teamwork yes they won the series but they've beaten an all-out of sorts Minnesota rocker team that um is not obviously good at all right now arguably one of the worst teams in the entire league and Vegas have Clay as basically their Superstar player right now which is great for clay and he's playing very high level Call of Duty but if you're relying on Clay to be the man to take over series like that it's not the team Dynamic you want like in your main AR position that's not the guy you want in the many are all to do the damage you want the SMGs you want it to be the flex or whatever to generally do the saying and the AR does you know the hardpoint work and whatever plays a fast-paced video it's going to get damaged gonna get engagements but the fact t",
      "hat Clay is the guy putting the team on his back is probably not long-term sustainable compared to some of the other teams in the league so I still think there's questions about this roster but regardless they type the series up 1-1 they win another Search and Destroy I thought they've heard they were going to win this it was going to be in a game five but I do really question again the decisions in the vetoes by the guys on the Minnesota rocker especially in the game five here I thought was a really remarkable veto they decided to go for they did end up winning the control so um Vegas go down 2-1 but again resilience from the guys on the Las Vegas Legion some nice plays here from 2-02 was looking like hookah major two here like he was windying a few shots but he was making it's a very valuable plays so I'm not saying okay tuber's got to go but you know there is an argument to say this experiment hasn't really worked out so well for Vegas but nonetheless they bring too real in they're on the verge of making it through to the winners packet so you've got to give them some credits but um you know I'm just still not sold completely on this I don't know what you guys think in the comment section below they did however win at the game four K was making plays look at the movement as well from the young man 18 and cracked straight into the lobby 99 overall and um you know he's in the perfect spot here they're not reading that one gets a kill gets the two piece closes out the game send it to a game five the resilience personified Clay is hyped as always I mean like he as I said the other day where they won their last series he's like the most passionate player in the league and he's almost 31 in just a couple of months time here and then game five rocker full collapse two will was again making good plays two cuts for The Rocker I'm a bit confused what they were even thinking here to be honest she will made a nice little Frank actually towards the end of this round they didn't read it didn't hear him maybe they need to turn on the loudest Equalization to be honest he gets the kill off the bomb stays alive and that's enough to win them that round that's up 3-1 they let TJ Ace them round one he then got streaks then claister was shooting by he's up 5-1 and I thought is this going to be you know they're going to come back but then TJ hit a sniper Temple then hit a snipe and then it was like okay probably over they closed it out six one in the ends wasn't even close and the most remarkable thing to me is this is Las Vegas legion's map this is the map where they never lose so far this season they are 8-0 on this map I believe there were 7-0 going into this series something like that and um and Rocco are like yeah we're telling them on it and they got bodies it's like well if you're gonna tell someone on the map you know they're good at at least have something in the tank that you can at least be competitive on it but if they'd have gone 6-4 you'd be like okay fair enough maybe they had some ideas but if it's six one it's like yeah damn really not a good showing at all and even as clay says GG's then one through two don't know why they're challenging us on the bread and butters right that's like yes their best map basically in the entire map Pool they challenge one at game five and um get bodies game five so not exactly a massive surprise look at the numbers they from K that was a 1.20 series KD the best that Clays had this season when 18 and 8 across the two searching and destroys season high for him so I'm you know starting off a good time 31 and two months and I was actually thinking about this right he's clayster the type of player that Minnesota actually needs because I would say the only man right now safe on Rocket is afro right even the coaching staff I mean again I know the coaching staff get brought in quite a lot when there are questionable vetoes and maybe that's understandable at times other times it's maybe the players that make the call but um you know still rocker yes they came top three at the major but outside of that their performances have been very lackluster bantz obviously isn't dropping 1.3 anymore which is expected you weren't expecting him to keep up that level he had during the entirety of major two afro's still been good and impactful but a bit inconsistent and then attach has a 1.17 but um you know you're looking at the numbers never tells you the whole story anyway because as a taxes here in the replies you know you fry into respawns play Bad in one respawn and the two searches your number's gonna look worse but still you know 54 deaths over you know five Maps right from your main ER you'd think that maybe you need a bit more engagements than that but because Kami was 71 and 71 and you know attached to most least damage in the lobby apart from too real so um you know I don't know there's some questions about rocker big questions at that I still do wonder whether this thing for Vegas can actually work as too well again didn't have a great series they relied on Clay heavily to win than this series but it's great to see clay delivering it he's making the most of his situation kind of like how slasher did last year on a bad Los Angeles grillers team he showed his worth in Search and Destroy face picked him up claser is doing the same thing right now I think on Vegas teams are clearly seeing Clay's value and yes Vegas and Clay might not win anything this year and they might not make a championship Sunday but regardless right clay has proven himself that he's still a top level player can still potentially improve plenty of teams in the league and maybe a bio could even be worthwhile for certain teams we shall see but what would you do if you're Minnesota rocker right now or like they got bodied here it was bad okay it was three two but like if you're losing to Vegas 3-2 with two World wig at 0.75 like um you know you've got to be doing better than that oh in four now right a nine map lost streak in search story used to be their bread and butter game modes now they're getting bullied on it tough to even say what to change what to move around but um you know I think it's quite clear that I would say afro spot is safe outside of that I have no clue really right they're probably gonna run it into the major to see what happens but after that they've got options on the bench over there they've got Fame you know they could bring in real the Spanish player there's options right they could potentially change around but I think something's going to happen with the AR Duo as well even though they paid a pretty penny to put the AR Duo together and speaking of blowing it up a weird series a close-up that I felt like this one was destined from game five before it even started to be honest mutinous vs gullies Genesis was kind of cooking game one but it was mutineers that win this in on this is a crazy map honestly I don't know how these well this one like sometimes you get these bad teams play each other and it's just like way more interning to watch than the good teams because it's just Madness on the map all the time and this is another example of that but a game one goes mutineers way they another like they close out another closely forward Zar Aqua hydroelectric hardpoint tear and then game two was the other way I thought to be honest father had this one look at this in jodeci's one two three like um I mean the third guy got destroyed but somehow they light up for the three-piece though I don't know how they let him get away with that one but another just comedy moment from one of the blowing up balls and it was as I say kind of destined to go all the way to the distance here when the end mutineers lost a very closely fought game four gorillas take it to a game five hype when the Hop one's been so bad lag but against Florida they can get the job done and this is the issue with this Florida team right is that you can't trust them in the game five anymore you can trust Havoc to play well as he was this series but they go up what 3-0 in the game five I think they're up 3-0 it then became 5-3 and boom good let's get their first win of the qualifiers and I don't think it's gonna be enough to put them into winners I don't think it's going to be good enough for Florida either to get them into winners so yeah not a deal for both teams and that's the thing with this uh Florida team their old team I think wins this series because they you know sneak something and they win a game five maybe their new team is maybe better in the race spawns but they just can't wear desserts right now which is a not a well not a good thing for this roster at all so both of you seems are terrible but um it was quite entertaining nonetheless hit the like button if you enjoyed subscribe if you're new take care and I'll see you next time",

    blocks: [
      " [Music] foreign [Music] your day so far the current power rankings of the CDL coaches has been revealed some interesting results and it is certainly in light of Champs qualification over the coming months but also Shotsy has he revealed on stream last night a potential new coach to be joining the optic Fray and a rather experienced one at that very much enjoy to your thoughts in the comments below hit the like button if you enjoy subscribe if you're new as always just wanted to look because I didn't show it last night the overall scoreboard from the gorillas vs Florida series Havoc at a 1.32 plus 26 almost 12K damage for the loss that's unfortunate 107 kills as well which is honestly not getting too far away from the records that we have in the CDL so far this season this actually goes to dash it 115 kills in a five map series a beast is 111 a seam at Civ Hydra Havoc tied four sixth most kills in the series for the loss so that's tough Los Angeles good is get the win and by getting the win at they put themselves in actually a not bad position here despite the fact that gorillas looked terrible and according to the coaches here in a second are the worst team in the world and we're not in the world in the league right okay fair enough we'll give them some credits but they'll actually be doing all right they find themselves in a spot where if they beat Vegas today they actually probably make a winner spacket and we'll see that in a second which is um you know kind of crazy to think about if they'd have lost this series three two and Florida probably should have won a game five after the first few rounds they played Florida would have eliminated themselves on winners back at contention but also eliminated lag from winners back at contention which would have effectively solidified Vegas Legion as in the winners bracket the way it is now though Vegas honestly I forgot a pretty hard time here because they've played some tricky qualifiers right Vegas they played two tough teams they beat thieves they now beat rocker yesterday and rocker confirmed losers Florida confirmed losers these are the four teams confirmed winners at Phase Ultra surgeon breach every other team over the coming days something can go wrong for but as we see gorillas subliners and optic we're expecting all those teams to make winners so there's only one team out of the remaining three that can make it and Legion are in prone position to do so but as I say had Florida won that Series yesterday that have been two in three gorillas would have been owing four out of contention but the two and three for mutineers would have been such a bad MAP count that uh you know they would have got through Legion effectively yesterday because London are also in a similar boat so they could have effectively guaranteed legion's progression to the Winner's racket for the first time in their history yes they had Florida won because they didn't it's now Legion versus gorillas today to effectively determine which team goes to Winners now there are some possibilities that even thieves subliners or Optic could collapse and um you know lose a load of maps and therefore they would find themselves losers that is possible but it's realistically unlikely and if there is a two in three tie between Legion and gorillas then you know there's gonna be the tiebreakers will favor the team that won the heads ahead first up which will be gorillas if they win tonight so Legion effectively have to win a go three and two which would be incredible result for them given the set of qualified as they had they're probably favorites to do it but it's not going to be easy Dudley put this together then last night so the four teams confirmed winners are phase Boston of course at Toronto and Seattle kind of you know classic Seattle stuff even though they've played three pretty bad teams I think they've played London Florida and Minnesota so not particularly impressive we've got Florida guaranteed loses as with Minnesota Rock Air then the sub Learners are 96 chance to go to winners at least this is based on like respective abilities between teams thieves are 98 chance so you know London still actually have an outside chance but it's probably not going to happen for them really it's between Las Vegas and Los Angeles grillers so who's going to make winners who's going to be losers there's a reasonable chance here that optic Mick losers as well just because if they get bodied by New York and phase and they probably are favorites to lose both of those Series right I think they'll win at least one of them but according to the coaches poll in the second they raped both the subliners and phases better teams that optic right now we'll see if that translates into the matches tonight and tomorrow but optic could still start in loses they get bodied but they probably won't and they should be okay so realistically it's between Vegas and Los Angeles grillers and that Series tonight is critical for how that's going to turn out just a quick update to the drama because we saw yesterday that attached was responding here and crimson's actually decided to know you want to attach I'm gonna come for the jugular as well he was going at him again on the fight last night as well and he goes on to say yeah cute damage though so basically saying yeah what are you playing at attach playing too slow and of course Crim is not a particularly big fan of players playing slow at all like his teams in the past at least in recent memory were very fast paced and would get at 0.95 but they would often win the series getting out slaves this guy brightly says racing Sim Merchant and chrome goes I was winning toilets when you were learning how to walk show some respect put some respect on the name so uh yeah I don't know what you guys think about that right we discussed it yesterday the attached situation and we know that this has been a conversation that's come up for a couple of years now certainly in Vanguard it was a thing that even cold war it was the thing where okay he's attached being his impact Fuller as he could be on the map and obviously when rookers start to lose then that question is uh brought up more often than it has done in the past now were the rocker sit in the coach's poll at power ranking so easy mac asked all the coaches like who do they think right now to rank their team except for their own team and together all the numbers and see what they come up with so if a Coach ranks a team at first they'll give them 11 points if they rank them last they'll give them one point and I think it they exclude their own team and instead of the article here they're out of all the coaches they asked them um okay who's gonna win major three eight of the coaches said phase three of them said thieves one of them said optic actually and that was excluding their own team so these are the numbers that they came up with here so these are effectively the power rankings looking at it in a tier list perspective looks like this this is what the coaches seem to believe right now so FaZe thieves in the estate that I think makes sense I know that some would maybe have thieves further down but it seems like the coaches actually believe that thieves and phases are very close together right now this of course is based in part on qualifiers so far based on the land at Major two but also based on scrims that's what I find so interesting about the coach's poll is that often the teams are giving their perspective all the coaches are giving their perspective based on what they see in practice at times just to you know see how good the team should be now In fairness teams like you know maybe thieves and octane have said that Boston are like the best team online but we haven't necessarily seen that translate yet so for now there the sixth best team according to the coaches so looking at the numbers and translating them into a tier list looks something like this but just on the pure numbers perspective it looks like this so phase 119 kind of um overall points that were tally together so phase and thieves one two then Toronto quite significantly behind and then kind of almost tied forth is subliners and optic right which probably makes sense right now but I'm there on about 90 points they got total then you take another step down to Boston and surge that are kind of in their own category with maybe Minnesota Rocky you can throw in there as well as the eighth best team but the thing is the rocker is that they're on this terrible snd lost streak so um you know the",
      " reality is that they're probably worse than that right now and then you've got the bottom four teams so we know that Vegas aren't great but they're you know they were right and they've obviously done pretty well here and they've got a chance to make winners they're better than folder they're better than Ravens but the um the teams have the coaches have gorillas as the worst team in the entire league right now so that bodes well for Vegas tonight in their crucial game to try and get to the winners brackets but um yeah It's tricky to say because a lot of these teams especially if I mean look these top eight teams right now we have are the top eight teams that I would expect to make it to the World Championship Vegas might have a chance I feel like it's you know over really for the millionaires Ravens and gorillas mutineers maybe but I doubt that anything's gonna happen with any other teams but rocker having fallen off maybe there's a chance that Vegas can try and overtake them it's not going to be easy of course but the coaches are quite clear that going into the major like um it's interesting that one of the coaches actually said that optic would be his favorites to win if it wasn't so you know if it wasn't his own team but nobody said Toronto or the subletters so maybe you know maybe there's an element there of optic home major this type of stuff that gave that coach their thought on what they should do or what they should give their prediction ads now also wanted to mention this it came from schott's stream so last night he was on we're playing ranked play of course after the games concluded with none other than Chris parasite Duarte now I know parents it's been obviously heading up the the ladder at times been right to the towards the top of it doesn't matter how shorty that shot to be so it was absolutely outrageous but he mentioned in kind of like a throwaway comment but I thought it was interesting because we know that whenever shotsi says something on stream there's always a chance that there's some leaked information coming out as a result of this and the parasite gives him some thoughts on what to do and Chelsea's like oh yes say less coach like you know I'll follow you up type thing next shot one side kitchen Alex we want to be on this side say let's coach restaurant's a bullet say let's coach say let's coach so thanks to Zach reporting to that clip out to me you're like I didn't unfortunately have a longer version of it because his uh Vaude is not available but do you think that was just like a throwaway comment there from a shot see where he's like oh yeah coach I'm saying you know experienced player igl of the team whatever the time like just let me know what to do and I'll follow you up type thing or was what's he saying that because there is a chance that they're considering parasite from some sort of coaching role because my perspective on optic is they've got rid of Rambo obviously it didn't work out they were Dashie but when they picked up ghosty they consulted parasite they consulted fellow of course fellow I thought honestly he might go with ghosty to be a coach of optic to be honest but he's now still a player again on Florida which is good for him but also parasite they consulted his wisdom on the the challenges players he recommended a ghosty of course he's playing a fair bit with schottzy in these ranked play games over the last few days and obviously okay JP craze is their kind of Coach analyst type role right now but he's not really the same coach maybe that other players could be he's not necessarily going to be the man management guy he's not necessarily going to be giving specific advice on certain rotations and stuff and I do feel like parasite could be a valuable culture optic maybe not on the man management side just because there's some questions about that but parasites played this game at a reasonable level in challenges and I always think that's a question with players like you know Rambo being a coach writers because Rama hasn't played the game on that level for some time so him giving advice to shots in to others as to how to play the game is like um yeah that's gonna cause some friction I think within the camp as it has done because people are like oh well does Rambo really know what he's talking about a type thing he certainly does from a Call of Duty level but on this specific game there's an argument to say that Rambo gave too much specific advice on how to actually play certain situations and maybe Paris I can give good advice on that front I don't know but I'm just not sure that long term optic not really having a coach whereas a lot of the other top teams do is the way to go and maybe there's a thought in shotsi's mind that you know maybe parasite could be a valuable option here maybe not even as like a full-time coach but as some sort of consultant for the team I don't know but I'm just thought it was certainly worth mentioning as we go towards the matches today also wanted to say this I thought it was kind of remarkable the beans jumps up right behind accuracy here in this game of hydro you can barely even hop up before he kills him and um you know be just like oh yeah look please turn your loudest Equalization up because how did he not hear me doing this so I thought it was pretty energetic actually like how did accuracy not hear him even if he didn't have allow the sequelization he'd have thought that he would have heard him to be honest and that because he's like I'm not a coward so I'm you know confirming that he doesn't use it such as like that's respectable but um of course we know that Sasha's team might be using it right now based on the information we heard from last weekend's so um yeah accuracy confirming that he doesn't use it and that pretty much confirms that as well these then are the four games of today so rocker vs thieves some honestly these are great games finally we have some good games Rooker thieves you've got a favor thieves right now like a rock over looked terrible they've played some bad teams and lost to them so thieves should you know mop the floor obviously they're on that nine losing streak in Search and Destroy which is pretty terrible they're gonna try and match faces winning week right now but um yeah they could lose another two searches today if they really want to do it if this went to game five but yeah I think thieves take this one three one or something I'll give rocker a map this time then gorilla's Legion I feel like this is gonna be a game five I'm gonna take Vegas to win there like I do want them to make winners so I'm hoping that they do so I'll take Legion game five I feel like it's gonna be a tight series though the control has been pretty bad for Vegas as well so I feel like gorillas could take that one so gonna be a tight series I think but I'm gonna take Legion to come out and get the winners back his spots Toronto vs London should be a Toronto win I'll take him 3-1 and then New York optic this is a banger I'm hoping that this goes the distance as well if it goes game five I think I'm gonna favor optic I feel like the control though does certainly favor sublaners that's what I'm most interested to see in this series is how optic can do in the control because subliners are pretty good on that game mode obviously giving banana game mode so far and they really need to start winning their controls up to give they're going to be a threat to a major three so that's the one that I'm keeping my eye out for this series but very much enjoyed to your thoughts in the comments below hit the like button if you enjoyed subscribe if you're new take care and I'll see you next time you all want to know a story about

      " foreign your day so far the final week of major 3 qualifiers is a Potter's Vegas Legion have a legitimate chance of making winners bracket for the first time in their franchise history but optic also need a good week as well going into their home major tough week to come but ghosts are though giving quite a lot of credit to himself for the turnaround in hoops performance so far in major three very much enjoyed to your thoughts in the comments below hit the like button if you enjoy subscribe if you're new as always I'd greatly appreciate a plenty to discuss firstly the elite stage 2 champions in North America from last night goes to Ulysses Pro loot Dave Patty and Johnny cool story for all these guys because of course Yuli like his entire team left him to go and to join the League go see among them Pro loot was recently dropped by Vegas Dave Patty had his stint on Florida then was gone again Dave funny is the absolute challenges reefer honesty and joined last year was also on Paris Legion as they were then and um yeah struggled to really find his grieving chances I think lately it's a cool story for all these guys but again Dave Patty man like every time you drop this guy he will just absolutely alter fighting challenges and you know hopefully you can only spot back at some point because I feel like he was somewhat harshly dealt with on the Florida team this season even scrubby giving some credit here to Prelude and the guy so yeah we'll see it's just a tough lead right now and especially with teams like Los Angeles grillers that did have money not maybe doing much anymore it just makes things even more challenging for these guys to try and find their spots back into the league Doug's also giving a get a go I thought this is quite funny I'll just try to share this on the full screen actually because while Doug turns on this guy cross map but um it's like this it's a slow-mo turn on like I don't exactly know who this is on maybe it was on newly but he turns up this guy and it takes like half an hour to get the kill but you know fair play he was having a good time Stanley also confirming he's a free agent for challenges going into Dallas so um of course he's on Toronto's bench right now and looking for a new challenges team I know that Paris thought I mentioned it just yesterday I think when parasites kind of retired from competing again but um you know I know that parasite was trying to get in bed with standing on it that way but in trying to get him on a team together and maybe haggy's like look well if you're on a team then I'm down and let's run it back or whatever so we'll see how that finds speaking of parasite I saw this tweet as well last night the fact is there's quite a few issues with this game yes ranked players doing well yes there's some other positive signs but um still slasher despite winning the most recent event still isn't happy with many things even I thought this is quite interesting Compares like control and potentially the worst map mode combinations of all time so yeah not happy with control as a game mode not happy with the map modes we have and nothing new really coming anytime soon by the time anything new does arrive into the game it's probably gonna be like major four major five Champs time where you're probably not going to want to change too much the rotation because I mean yeah you can change the map said when you're mid-season but changing the map set you know an event before the world championship probably not going to cut it so we might just be stuck with this until the end of the season unfortunately but you know it's more entertaining and better to play than I think I expected it to be to be honest this year let's talk optic though so this other one was kind of crazy optic gaming roster breakdown during the last um almost the last decade so um between 2014 and 20 2018 they won 18 championships and they had very few changes at all nature retired Karma came in karma had to get well enable that to come in briefly before Karma could get his Visa sorted and then Karma was there for the next four years they won an awful lot since then when Karma retired and then although optic drama happened when it became up to gaming Los Angeles right that this was during the Black Ops four days but even after that when everything happened with optic Chicago and Chicago Huntsman and all this drama like um to be fair a lot of the changes during this period after the dynasty broke up were kind of expected I think it's really the more recent stuff like it's this past season where things go kind of insane with Illy going to the starting team then getting drops then dashies dropped and he's picked back up then dashies back up then dashies bench then hook us in then scum retires them if he's dropped again like it's been absolute Madness these last few months dropping but ghosty is now in the starting team and looking at all these changes over the last five years compared to the changes over the dynasty period how many more changes are to come we know that hex what he said on the process that he's trying to fight find long-term franchise pieces and well I just found those long-term franchise pieces right they are Dashi he's made that very clear and they are shots he rides whether that's who can go see we'll see that's the question down the line but ghosty is definitely giving himself a lot of credit to maybe understandably for the turnaround in part of their team's performance so far and just looking at the optimism that goes he has for the future because of course it was Dashi and shots in a way that made the chords a bit ghosty up there was no general manager that made the decision to finally pick up a challenge display that opt to give never really done in their history and yes they consulted fellow and parasite to get their opinion on ghosty and whether they should sign him and there you go ghosty makes a statement in this really great interview that and Stone Lake did for Esports GG I have no interest in looking cool I'm interested in winning so this is a greater interview there's a lot a lot to be said about this but I'll just mention a few quotes here that I thought were interesting saying that he wants to go down as one of the greats to obviously to achieve that he's gonna win at least one world championship and win a lot outside of that I just want to win at the end of the day I want to go down as one of the best Call of Duty players and don't want to lose sight of that guy I've got no interest in looking cool on the map I'm interested in winning that's quite the statement from ghosty right because I know that when he joined the team people were like oh yeah what are these guys stacked in challenges right is he good like is he dropping 1.3 is which he was in challenges so far in the CDL his numbers haven't been lights out like that but it doesn't really matter if you're enabling the rest of your team to go off so I think that's where ghosty is we know that he likes to sit in the hardpoints an awful lot and soak up the time that maybe one of their SMGs would have to do we talked about this quite a bit with phase actually and their SMG lineup the way that simp is often sitting in the hill soaking up time which is fine and they're winning events and stuff but it's mainly been down to their Search and Destroy their winning events that harp on has been a bit sketchy maybe there's an argument to say you want your Flex Pay or want someone of your ARS just soaking the hill time so your SMGs can go off and go Rogue and do what they want which is certainly what Shotsy and hook like to do and ghosty believes he's enabling them to do exactly that so um as he says I thought was actually quite an interesting commentary really everyone hyped this pickup of myself in his shoes obviously to be the traditional four Superstar optic roster because he doesn't really see it like that he says instead of being the Superstar I have to be the facilitator in the comms and I have to enable them the best that I can I know in the back of my head that if my teammates were at 100 I can be at 10 and we'll still win every series as long as I could do what I need to do and facilitate the team will win that's how I see it it's that simple and um of course he talked about the possibility of you know winning the World Championship saying okay the percentages are low because everyone wants it and it's playing well but he's playing with Dashi best shot in the game and then multi-fps players and champions in who can shot see the talent is there to make it happen sa",
      "ying okay we don't really care about losing to Tron takers who have been frying everything's good over here Good Vibes always giggling they believe in me and trust me which I think is very important because that might not have been the case with Elite towards the end of his tenure on the team over the last week I don't really feel the pressure anymore so yeah pretty interesting from ghosty right because he's basically saying that going into this weekend's I think it's been kind of obvious with some of the players go see I think included but also even with beans the first series they played in the league was you know maybe not their best series ever right they're going to be nervous they're first match in the CDL with all the audience especially for kosi playing for optic and especially because he's gonna be playing four uptake in front of Optics home crowd in Texas where they won the event last year like um that's a lot of pressure right now he says he doesn't feel the pressure anymore which is certainly a positive sign but this statement I thought was probably the most interesting of the bunch he says okay if we looked uncomfortable against Toronto because they weren't dying so um you know the internet stuff I guess what Dashi was talking about the other day people have been saying though that Kai let that being Hooke is super frying but the thing is that I'm allowing Kyla and ants that being Shotsy to do whatever they want on the map Brannon also helps make my life easy so we can continue to make our subs look like Superstars so this has been the question about this Teamwork because ever since ghosty came in it's been Dashi that individually hasn't been quite at the same level on average but it's been hook especially but also shotty to a certain extent that have leveled up their game is this merely a coincidence or is this well certainly not as far I was ghostly believes like ghosty believes that he's effectively allowing Kyla to do this because he can sit in the harbor and get the time and allow them to do what they want to the map and I do believe that giving them that freedom has opened them up a little bit to being more impactful and playing in the way they want to play because who can shots him they've been around for a long time and they've played together for a long time they know how they want to work as an SMG Joey if ghosty is allowing them to do that then that's very well very positive for the team or do you guys think this is like a short-term phenomenon where they've not played like the sample size isn't massive okay like Hook's been great at Major three but they've played what three matches so far in major three so you know it's not necessarily going to be a consistent Trend and if all of a sudden shots in who don't perform quite so well then what does that mean for the ARs like is ghosty limiting Dashi in a way I know aches made that points but you know he's a circular what can you say about that one really so I just thought it was interesting about that he's giving him he's obviously confident guy right because he's giving himself the credits for unlocking hug and shotty to a certain extent which might well be valid but I think we're really gonna see this during major three I also wanted to show around they click from ghosty on well he was playing eight he was getting really frustrated with the Ping and basically just like quit the game and I know that people were commenting on this saying oh you know like here he goes ghosty joins up to gets the ego gets the kind of Diva mentality he'll fit right in but um you know there's always different sides of the story on this stuff bro bro I'm running a sniper I'm not playing bro I'm not playing on Triple they're Ping Man it is not fair I'm not coming back what's one shot in P2 bro all right oh yeah no like just no the answer is no the server is broken bro he's on half the Ping of me he's on half the Ping pingy brother yeah I am not playing on that it's just like I peek and I'm just dead yeah Alex on 70. I know like what do you mean if I showed my POV right now people would be laughing at my sort of God this won't take play in New York subliners tomorrow the Champions are major one they play Phase on Sunday the champions of course of major two I thought it was interesting to look at the Brian statue when he looked at the overall records all time between optic and phase they're 77th career matchup that's remarkable to think about really like too real OG teams of Call of Duty Esports going back up you know decade really at this point but in terms of even recent memory optic have generally got the better of them recently it's 40 in 36 to optic right now I'm guessing in Cold War Phase got the better of them but in more recently in Vanguard and even so far in this game up to give I think they're six in one against them Optic versus phase in the last couple of years but uh yeah 40 in 36 for optague will FaZe get their win it will optic make the season head to head two and do it in their favor we will have to see also this comment I thought was interesting just because we know now that sellium at least last week turned on the loudness Equalization phase of doing all this talk about oh they don't use it it's their bottom four teams that are cheating guten the loudest Equalization all this stuff but um Dashi it kind of replied to RC so he's talking about the Astro like I guess presets audio settings you can go for and Jesse's like oh yeah I prefer the loudest Equalization because that's a superior to both of these in terms of hearing everything so I don't necessarily think dashies are like is saying oh I'm using it now but um it is interesting right because if you're playing Phase in a very important series and you know that selim is using it which well he turned it on last week we believe that I got confirmed by slasher so if you know that psyllium's using it would you just not use it for a very important series like that I don't know maybe you would just turn it on possibly even though you can't use it on that we'll see but I thought an interesting question to keep your eyes on also speaking of phase this is their 11 s d game at win streak gonna buy the numbers here starting with the cover against Boston when they went game five a couple of these series but um I mean yeah these are all the ones they've won lots of round 11 clutches in here quite a few of them of course one of which was at the major right when they won that six five a bz clutch to take them over the line to win an entire series but versus optic this weekend it's gonna be big for them so they're only 11 win streak going into the up series map 2 will potentially prove crucial in that particular series one thing I thought was crazy when I saw this graphic come out for the CDL this morning it was Vegas Legion Road to Winners brackets this could be the first time in legion's franchise history where they sat in the winners bracket now of course way back in Modern Warfare they didn't have the same format they have today it came in in Cold War where we had the qualifiers going into the regular major type cycle but ever since like in Caldwell of course they were pretty bad in Vanguard it was Next Level tow bar and they never have ever made winners so this is their chance they're currently one in two they beat Los Angeles thieves and they lost a phase and they lost I think Toronto I think so like they've had a pretty rough go of things but they play rocker and gorillas both teams that I think don't have a win so far this stage so Vegas have surely got to in one of these series I think Vegas even have a positive record against rockers so far this season so like I want to take them to win this series tonight and if they do they should be in winners bucket at the major I really want I would I want to see them there right even if they don't do one of the major I don't really mind it just seeing it Vegas in winners legionate winners would be a great story and if it doesn't happen now it's probably never gonna happen to be honest these are the games though tonight to the uh blow it up Friday here it is we've got Ravens versus Surge we've got Legion versus Rocco which is a very interesting series for that reason I just mentioned the other series not so much gorillas Florida to close out the day it's like why is that good I'll have to find something else to watch I think for that one but very much in tweet your thoughts in the comments below hit the like button if you enjoyed subscribe if you want to you take care and I'll see you next time",

The speaker also mentions that Optic has generally been performing better than their opponent, FaZe, in recent years and that the upcoming match between the two teams will be interesting to watch. Additionally, the speaker mentions the use of loudness equalization in the game and how it may affect a match against FaZe, who is rumored to use it. Lastly, the speaker discusses the upcoming matches for the day and expresses excitement for Vegas Legion to potentially make it to the winners bracket for the first time in their franchise history.",
