            "The final week of the Major 3 qualifiers is coming up, and there's a lot of pressure on teams like OpTic and Vegas Legion to perform well. Last night's elite stage 2 champions in North America were Ulysses Pro, Loot, Dave Patty, and Johnny, who all have unique stories and experiences in their careers. Slasher, despite winning the most recent event, is still not happy with some aspects of the game, such as the control game mode and map modes. OpTic's roster changes over the past five years have been numerous and chaotic, but Ghost is now in the starting team and believes in the team's potential for success in the future. Ghost emphasizes the importance of winning over looking cool on the map and sees himself as a facilitator for his teammates to succeed.",
